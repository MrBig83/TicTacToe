# TicTacToe
A simple console game where two players enter X or O in a 3x3 grid. 
3 Xs or Os in a row = win. :) 

ToDo: 
1. Second chance to input an X or an O if the desired square is occupied. 
2. Win (or tie) determination. (Tie breaker? Maybe choose a number between 1-100, closest guess wins. IDK.)
3. Input filtering. (Right now anyone can enter anything, which breaks the game) 
4. Menu. (Just for the fun of it. Start and exit)
