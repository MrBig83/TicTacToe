# TicTacToe
A simple console game where two players enter X or O in a 3x3 grid. 
3 Xs or Os in a row = win. :) 

ToDo: 
1. Second chance to input an X or an O it the desired square is occupied. 
2. Win determination. 
3. Input filtering. (Right now anyone can enter anything, which breaks the game) 
4. Menu. (Just for the fun of it. Start and exit)
